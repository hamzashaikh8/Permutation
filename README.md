# Permutation
Permutation implementation in Java of two versions of a program that deals with two strings, referred to as shortStr and longStr. 
The program attempts to find if any/all possible permutation of shortStr exists within longStr, and if so, at which location on longStr. 
Two solutions to display all the permutations of a string. The first version uses recursion and has a time complexity of O(n!) whereas the second solution has a time complexity of O(n^2)
and manipulates an array using the sorting method from java.util.Arrays. These two versions showcase the importance of time complexity in coding.
